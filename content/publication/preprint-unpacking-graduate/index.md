abstract: "The study was conducted in an Advanced Quantitative Research Methods course involving 20 graduate students. During the course, student inquiries made to the AI were recorded and coded using Bloom's taxonomy and the CLEAR framework. A series of independent sample t-tests and poisson regression analyses were employed to analyse the characteristics of different questions asked by students with different backgrounds. Post course interviews were conducted with 10 students to gain deeper insights into their perceptions. The findings revealed a U-shaped pattern in students' use of the AI assistant, with higher usage at the beginning and towards the end of the course, and a decrease in usage during the middle weeks. Most questions posed to the AI focused on knowledge and comprehension levels, with fewer questions involving deeper cognitive thinking. Students with a weaker mathematical foundation used the AI assistant more frequently, though their inquiries tended to lack explicit and logical structure compared to those with a strong mathematical foundation, who engaged less with the tool. These patterns suggest the need for targeted guidance to optimise the effectiveness of AI tools for students with varying levels of academic proficiency."
